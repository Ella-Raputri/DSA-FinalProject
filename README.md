## Description
To solve for the problem of "What is the best data structure that enables an administrator to effectively manage questions in a quiz with the fastest running time and less memory usage?", we did some benchmarking in this repository to determine the best data structure for the quiz management system. We tested it using 1000 questions in 6 types of data structures (Array List, Hash Map, Linked List, Red Black Tree, Queue, and Stack). We compared their average time and space consumed for eight processes (add, delete, edit, change order to middle number, change order to first number, change order to last number, print, and search).

## Benchmarking Result
After the benchmarking process, we concluded that the winner is Linked List. To view the full result, please click [here](https://s.id/26r56). After we reach the conclusions, we decided to make a GUI implementation of quiz management system using Linked List, which can be accessed from the link before.
